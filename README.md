# Landing Page Project

## Description

This project required to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

First step was download the code starter. The code only have the structure of the landing page. The goal was create dynamically the Nav Menu and add and remove active states in Java Script.

In app.js I write in comments at the beginning of each procedure.

For this project I only used references from the Udacity Knowlage page.

To improve my skills of project 1 I modified the html and css of the inicial code and create a possible landing page for personal use in future.

With this project I learn much more about JavaScript and how to apply what I learn.
