# Landing Page Project

## Description

This project requires me to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Instructions

Here are the Rubric Tip: 

1. Start by linking your app.js
2. Build out your HTML and at least 4 content sections.
3. Build the navigation menu - This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page.
4. Add functionality to distinguish the section in view. While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.
5. Add the functionality to scroll to sections. Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.
6.REFACTOR. At this point, your code should be working properly. Ideally, refactoring happens while you are developing, but as a new developer, you often don’t have the whole picture in your head to be able to do so properly. Let’s clean the project up.
7.Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
8.Responsive landing page - A Responsive layout of the landing page should be created to use across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.

## Conclusion

In this project I felt some difficults in JavaScript. I hope to be successful!
